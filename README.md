### Table of Contents
Title | Notes
------- | --------
[Nucleotide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide) | Nucleotides form the basic structural unit of nucleic acids such as DNA.
[Genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome) | A genome is the complete set of genetic information in an organism. It provides all of the information the organism requires to function.
[Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation) | Messenger RNA (mRNA) is decoded in a ribosome, outside the nucleus, to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide.
[DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) | Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a polymer composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development.
[RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) | Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes.
