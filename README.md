#### Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19)
Abstract: *SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, that is contagious in humans and responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.*

### Table of Contents
Title | Notes
------- | -------
[Genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome) | A genome is the complete set of genetic information in an organism. It provides all of the information the organism requires to function.
[RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA) | Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes.
[Nucleotide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide) | A nucleotide is the basic building block of nucleic acids. RNA and DNA are polymers made of long chains of nucleotides. They function as the fundamental units of the genetic code, with the bases A, G, C, and U being found in RNA while A, G, C, and T are found in DNA.
[Codon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code) | A codon divides the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) molecule into a set of consecutive, non-overlapping triplets. These triplets equate to amino acids or start/stop signals during translation.
[Amino Acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid) | Amino acids are organic compounds but only 20 appear in the genetic code.
[Peptide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide) | Peptides are short chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. A polypeptide is a longer, continuous, unbranched peptide chain. Chains of fewer than twenty amino acids are called oligopeptides.
[Transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(biology)) | Transcription is the first step in gene expression. It involves copying a gene's DNA sequence to make an RNA molecule.
[Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation) | Messenger RNA (mRNA) is decoded in a ribosome, outside the nucleus, to produce a specific amino acid chain or polypeptide.
[Reading Frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_frame) | A reading frame is defined by the initial triplet of nucleotides from which translation starts.
[N-Terminus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-terminus) | The N-terminus (also known as the amino-terminus, NH2-terminus, N-terminal end or amine-terminus) is the start of a protein or polypeptide.
[C-Terminus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-terminus) | The C-terminus (also known as the carboxyl-terminus, carboxy-terminus, C-terminal tail, C-terminal end, or COOH-terminus) is the end of an amino acid chain.
[Molecular Weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_mass) | The sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule.
