#### Gene expression and protein analysis.
Abstract: *The genetic code is the set of rules used by living cells to translate information encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences of nucleotide triplets, or codons) into proteins.*

### Glossary
Title | Notes
------- | -------
[Genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome) | A genome is the complete set of genetic information in an organism. It provides all of the information the organism requires to function.
[DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA) | Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)  is a polymer composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses.
[RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA) | Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes.
[Nucleotide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide) | A nucleotide is the basic building block of nucleic acids. RNA and DNA are polymers made of long chains of nucleotides. They function as the fundamental units of the genetic code, with the bases A, G, C, and U being found in RNA while A, G, C, and T are found in DNA.
[Codon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code) | A codon divides the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) molecule into a set of consecutive, non-overlapping triplets. These triplets equate to amino acids or start/stop signals during translation.
[Amino Acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid) | Amino acids are organic compounds but only 20 appear in the genetic code.
[Peptide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide) | Peptides are short chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. A polypeptide is a longer, continuous, unbranched peptide chain. Chains of fewer than twenty amino acids are called oligopeptides.
[Transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(biology)) | Transcription is the first step in gene expression. It involves copying a gene's DNA sequence to make an RNA molecule.
[Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(biology)) | Translation is the process in which ribosomes synthesize a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide. The polypeptide later folds into an active protein and performs its functions in the cell.
[Reading Frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_frame) | A reading frame is defined by the initial triplet of nucleotides from which translation starts.
[N-Terminus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-terminus) | The N-terminus (also known as the amino-terminus, or N-terminal end) is the start of a protein or polypeptide.
[C-Terminus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-terminus) | The C-terminus (also known as the carboxy / carboxyl-terminus or C-terminal end) is the end of an amino acid chain.
[Molecular Weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_mass) | The sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule.
[Theoretical pI / Isoelectric Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoelectric_point) | The pH at which a molecule carries no net electrical charge.
[N-end rule (Halflife)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-end_rule) | A rule which governs the rate of protein degradation, operating differently across yeast, mammals and e.coli.
[Atomic Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element) | The general formula of protein is RCH(NH2)COOH, where C is carbon, H is hydrogen, N is nitrogen, O is oxygen and R is a group.
[Charged Residues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinogenic_amino_acid) | The sum of positively charged residues (Arg | Lys | His) and negatively charged residues (Asp | Glu | Cys | Tyr).
[Extinction Co-efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_attenuation_coefficient) | How strongly a protein or molecular species absorbs light at a given wavelength.
[Instability Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability_index) | An estimate of the stability of your protein in a test tube. A protein whose instability index is smaller than 40 is predicted as stable.
[Aliphatic Index](http://www.russelllab.org/aas/aliphatic.html) | The relative volume occupied by aliphatic side chains. (Ala | Val |Â Ile | Leu).
[Hydropathicity Index (GRAND Average)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobicity_scales) | The sum of the hydropathy values of all the amino acids divided by the sequence length.
